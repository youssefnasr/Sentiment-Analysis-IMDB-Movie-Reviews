# Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB-Movie-Reviews

About

The dataset contains a collection of 50,000 reviews from the IMDB Website with an equal number of positive and negative reviews. The task is to predict the polarity (positive or negative) of a given review(text).

I used Deepnote to do the data analysis on IMDB dataset, its easy and fast to setup plus provides great collaboration tools. What I most like is the ability to plug and play from multiple data sources. If you are new and starting your data science journey I highly recommend to check it out.
